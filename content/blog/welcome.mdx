# Welcome to MNRTC!

We're excited to announce the **Minnesota Retro Technology Club** - a new community for retro and vintage technology enthusiasts right here in the Twin Cities!

## What We're About

The Minnesota Retro Technology Club exists as a user's group for retro/vintage computer and technology enthusiasts. Our mission is to:

- **Connect people** within the community
- **Preserve** computing history
- **Provide educational outreach** to the community
- **Share knowledge** and experiences

## All Are Welcome

Whether you're a seasoned collector with a garage full of vintage computers, a hobbyist who enjoys tinkering with old tech, or someone who's just curious about the computers and technology of yesteryear - there's a place for you here.

You don't need to bring anything except your enthusiasm. No collection required, no project necessary - just come as you are!

## What's Next?

We're currently in the planning phase, finalizing meeting locations and schedules. Our proposal is to meet on the **second Sunday of every month from 1-5 PM CT** somewhere in the Twin Cities metro area.

### How to Get Involved

- **Join the mailing list** on [Groups.io](https://groups.io/g/mnretrotech)
- **Join our Discord** at [discord.gg/hF9wh6gPcP](https://discord.gg/hF9wh6gPcP)
- **Read our full proposal** to learn more about the club's vision

## Looking Forward

This is just the beginning! We're building something special here in Minnesota, inspired by great organizations like the Atlanta Historical Computing Society, Seattle Retro Computing Society, and many others.

Stay tuned for more updates, and we can't wait to meet you at our first meeting!
