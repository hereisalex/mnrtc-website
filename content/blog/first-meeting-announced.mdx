# First Meeting Coming Soon!

We're getting closer to our first official Minnesota Retro Technology Club meeting, and we want YOUR input!

## What We're Planning

Our goal is to hold meetings on the **second Sunday of every month from 1-5 PM CT**. The format will include:

- **1-2 PM**: Casual hangout and "free table" (bring items to share/give away)
- **2-4 PM**: Main meeting with presentations and discussions
- **4-5 PM**: Wrap-up, free table, and teardown

## Help Us Choose

We're currently looking at several potential venues in the Twin Cities metro area:

- Libraries with meeting rooms
- Community centers
- Coffee shops with event spaces
- Other suggestions welcome!

## Requirements

We need a space with:
- Seating for everyone
- Sturdy tables (to support CRTs and tower PCs!)
- Power outlets
- Easy parking and access

## Join the Discussion

Head over to our Discord or mailing list to share your thoughts:

- **Discord**: [discord.gg/hF9wh6gPcP](https://discord.gg/hF9wh6gPcP)
- **Groups.io**: [groups.io/g/mnretrotech](https://groups.io/g/mnretrotech)

We're listening to the community and want to make sure our first meeting is accessible and welcoming to everyone!

## What to Bring

Nothing required! But if you want to:
- Bring a vintage computer or device to show off
- Bring items for the free table
- Prepare a short presentation (5-15 minutes)
- Just bring yourself and your enthusiasm

Stay tuned for the official date announcement!
