- `wordmark.svg` - Wordmark logo
- All images in `public/images/`

## ✏️ How to Add Content

### Add a Blog Post

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in `content/blog/`:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2025-10-15"
description: "A brief description"
author: "Your Name"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---

# Your Content

Write your content here using markdown...
```

2. The post will automatically appear in the blog listing and be accessible at `/blog/your-filename`

### Update Events

Currently, events are in `app/events/page.tsx`. You can:
- Edit the `sampleEvents` array to add new events
- Or create a dynamic system using JSON/MDX files in `content/events/`

### Modify Pages

All pages are in the `app/` directory:
- `app/page.tsx` - Home page
- `app/about/page.tsx` - About page
- `app/proposal/page.tsx` - Proposal page
- etc.

Just edit the files and save - changes appear immediately in development mode!

## 🎨 Customizing the Design

### Colors

Edit `app/globals.css` to change Mac OS 9 colors:
```css
:root {
  --mac-platinum: #dddddd;  /* Main background */
  --mac-blue: #0000dd;      /* Links and highlights */
  /* etc. */
}
```

### Fonts

The site uses Chicago and Geneva fonts with fallbacks. To add actual font files:
1. Place `.woff` or `.woff2` files in `public/fonts/`
2. Update the `@font-face` declarations in `app/globals.css`

## 🌐 Deploying to Production

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended - FREE)

1. Push your code to GitHub:
```bash
cd mnrtc-website
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Sign in with GitHub
4. Click "New Project"
5. Import your repository
6. Click "Deploy"

Done! Your site will be live at `your-project.vercel.app`

### Option 2: Custom Domain (mnretrotech.org)

In Vercel:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Click "Domains"
3. Add `mnretrotech.org`
4. Follow the DNS configuration instructions

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for more deployment options.

## 🔧 Development Commands

```

## 📝 Known Items

### Fonts
The site references Chicago and Geneva fonts but uses fallbacks (Impact, Arial). This is fine, but you can add actual Mac OS 9 fonts if you have them.

### Font 404 Errors
You'll see 404 errors in the console for missing fonts. This is expected and doesn't affect functionality - the fallback fonts work perfectly.

### Optional Enhancements

Future additions you might want:
- Actual Mac OS 9 font files
- Comment system for blog posts
- Newsletter signup form
- Member directory
- Photo gallery
- Google Calendar integration for events
- Search functionality
