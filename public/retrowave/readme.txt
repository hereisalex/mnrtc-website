Author's description:

It's a perfect throwback to the old times, matching Retro Wave/Synthwave Themes. Have fun using these animated Synth-colored "Rainbows"! (light blue, dark blue, purple, orange, yellow)
Yes, these are nothing but recolored Windows 10 cursors. I wanted to keep the default look of a cursor with tweaked colors
